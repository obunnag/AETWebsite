    <h2 class="specialtyTitles">What is Arts and Entertainment Technology?</h2>
    <p class="headerPragraph">Arts and Entertainment Technologies (AET) is the first
      Bachelor of Science degree offered by the College of Fine Arts in the
      School of Design and Creative Technologies at The University of Texas
      at Austin. In this interdisciplinary major, creative expression
      merges with technological innovation. AET foundational courses deliver
      creative coding fundamentals, an introduction to a wide range of
      creative production software and a colloquium series of guest
      speakers. Students advance to projects-based coursework drawn
      from four emphasis areas: Game Design; Digital Visualization;
      Performance, Lighting and Interactivity (PLAI); and Music
      and Sound. In addition to completing the university’s core
      curriculum, students will also complete a secondary field of study
      in a complementary area, such as Business Foundations, Elements
      of Computing, Integrated Design or Studio Art. Graduates of AET
      will be prepared to create digital content, lead production
      teams and develop new applications of technology in the
      evolving entertainment industry.</p>

      Digital Visualization courses provide a pathway for students pursuing
      careers as visual content providers for a wide range of activities
      including game design, 3-D projection, character animation, world
      building, AR/VR and many areas of commercial art pursuits such as
      motion graphics and digital video editing. Through foundational courses
      in imaging and visualization, digital drawing and 3-D modeling,
      students are introduced to industry-standard software like Adobe
      Creative Cloud, Autodesk Maya and Unity. Students are encouraged to
      collaborate with all the other AET emphases and with other creative
      disciplines across the College of Fine Arts and beyond.
